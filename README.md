# Simulation-and-Fabrication-of-a-Standard-Horn-Antenna

>Simulation in CST

In the following project, a **Standard Horn Antenna** has been simulated and fabricated from scratch. 

The Standard Gain Horn Antenna was designed to work in the frequency range of **5.85 GHz** to **8.20 GHz**, and respective simulations were done using **CST Studio Suite** software.

The antenna could achieve a gain of **14.7 dBi** through simulations.

In addition to calculating the gain, the **S11** parameter was calculated. S11 is known as the reflection coefficient and represents how much power is reflected from the antenna. For the simulated Horn antenna, the S11 parameter was around **-10 dB**.

It is worth mentioning that all simulations were executed in the HFSS environment, too.

> Fabrication

After receiving promising results from the simulation step, the project entered the fabrication phase. To this end, an Aluminum sheet was prepared, cut to proper sizes, and then Argon boiled, all with the help of specialists of the corresponding fields.
