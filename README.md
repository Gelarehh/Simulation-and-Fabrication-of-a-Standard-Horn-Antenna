# Simulation-and-Fabrication-of-Standard-Horn-Antenna

>Simulation in CST

In the following project, an **Standard Horn Antenna** has been simulated and fabricated from scratch. 

The Standard Gain Horn Antenna was designed to work in the frequency range of **5.85 GHz** to **8.20 GHz**, and respective simulations were done using **CST Studio Suite** software.

The antenna could achieve a gain of **14.7 dBi** through simulations.

In addition to calculating the gain, the **S11** parameter was calculated. S11 is known as the reflection coefficient and represents how much power is reflected from the antenna. For the simulated Horn antenna, the S11 parameter was around **-10 dB**.

It is worth mentioning that all simulations were re-executed in the **HFSS** environment, too.

> Fabrication

After receiving promising results from the simulation step, the project entered the fabrication phase. To this end, an **Aluminum sheet** of a specific thickness was prepared, cut to prespecified sizes, and then Argon boiled, all with the help of specialists of the corresponding fields.
